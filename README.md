# Text Spam (for trolling my siblings, no malicious intent)

This was done using the pyautogui library.

## Installation

A quick installation guide can be found here:

## Purpose
I remember seeing a meme where someone wrote a script that spams the bee movie script to their girlfriend/friend and that really sparked my interest in programming.
I wanted to build something similar to annoy my siblings and to be a menace.

I am aware that it's unethecical to spam people and I haven't used it since 2021. However, this has to be one of my proudest projects as I've used what I've learnt from
first year university, undertaking my own research into using different python libraries (includes pygame) and learning how to use a documentation to help me produce better code.

## Project structure
First year programming covered reading and writing to files using python, I figured I could leverage that as means of storing the bee movie script in a .txt file. I then used the 
pyautogui library to automatically type each line of text.

This was built for fun and got me into scripting and programming.
